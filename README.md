# VH Mentorship Workshop 2 Take-Home #2: To-Do-List Upgrade

## Instructions

Your goal for this take-home assignment is to expand on the to-do list template presented in the workshop. Our goal is for you to come out of this workshop series with a tangible portfolio-ready project and a deeper understanding of front-end technologies. This is one of your chances to do so! As always, feel free to play around with the HTML, CSS, & JS source code to personalize the app.

## Challenge 1

During the workshop, you learned a bit about what a React component is. Our first challenge for you is to design a component that simply counts the number of tasks present in the list at any given moment. Don't be afraid to use the Internet as a resource to aid your efforts!

## Challenge 2

Currently, the app does not include a way for users to assign a priority value to tasks. Using the qualifiers "High", "Medium", and "Low," create a drop-down menu that allows users to associate a task with its given priority level. In addition, design a component that allows the user to quickly search for tasks according to their query (e.g. if they only want to see tasks with high priority, show them that).

## Have fun!

We're excited to see what you all come up with! Note that these challenges are just suggestions, so feel free to run with your own ideas on how to further increase the app's functionality in an elegant way. Don't hesitate to reach out to VH Content members and pod leaders for assistance!
